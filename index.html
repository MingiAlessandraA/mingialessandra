            <h3>Self Introduction</h3>
            <p>I am Alessandra Mingi from Nangka 1, Mogpog Marinduque, currently taking a BS in Information Technology at Marinduque State College. I took this program because I believe it's a high-demand field with lots of job opportunities. While this program has been quite the challenge, introducing me to new and sometimes daunting topics, I find satisfaction in the learning process. I do enjoy the designing process, though I must admit, being in the world of coding can be tough and confusing at times, but it is all worth it in the end. Outside of academics, I find solace in watching movies and series, exploring different genres and narratives. I'm excited to connect with like-minded individuals and continue my journey in the field of IT.</p>

            <h3>Background on Information Technology</h3>
            <p>As a second-year information technology student, I have an understanding of computer hardware and software, which is essential for any student entering the field of information technology. This includes knowing the basic components of a computer system, such as the CPU, RAM, storage devices, and peripherals like keyboards and mice. Additionally, familiarity with operating systems such as Windows or macOS, as well as basic software applications like word processors and web browsers, I also have knowledge about different programming languages, as we are already on our third programming language. I am taking a broad field; it's still confusing and challenging at times. I can't really say that I am already an expert in this field. I have a lot more to learn and to improve as I take this path. With an open mindset and a strong desire to learn, I am poised to go deeper into the world of technology, eager to expand my skill set and adapt to fast-paced technology.Â </p>
